            1)What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?
            <br>
            The hardest struggles were fixing bugs with the assignment in terms of a logic error. I solved them by going through Piazza and referring to recorded lectures.

            2)What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?
            <br>
            I didn't know much about javascript going into it. After going through the assignment I learned a lot about javascript syntax and how it's similar to C++ in some ways.
