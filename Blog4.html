        </h2>
        <p>
            1)What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?
            <br>
            The hardest struggles were learning js server code and knowing which ones to use. I solved them by going through Piazza and referring to recorded lectures.
            <br>
            2)What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?
            <br>
            I didn't have any prior knowledge about backend code before this assignment. I learned a lot about how to use servers and testing code for it which is similar to normal js.
            <br>
            3)What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?
            <br>
            Piazza as it helped that I ran into similar problems my peers did and also lectures notes whenever I was looking for a function.
            <br>
            4)What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?
            <br>
            How to get started with node js and how to install npm.
