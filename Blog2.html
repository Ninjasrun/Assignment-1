        </h2>
        <p>
            1)What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?
            <br>
            The hardest struggles were getting used to css and it's special functions. I solved them by going through Piazza and referring to recorded lectures.
            <br>
            2)What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?
            <br>
            I didn't know much about css going into it. I learned a lot about flexbox and hovering as it was what I had to do most of the time.
            <br>
            3)What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?
            <br>
            Piazza as it helped that I ran into similar problems my peers did and asking a TA's after demoing the previous assignment.
            <br>
            4)What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?
            <br>
            Flexbox tutorials and border radius as they were both confusing at first to handle.
